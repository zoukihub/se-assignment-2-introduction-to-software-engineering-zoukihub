Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
    Software Engineering is a branch of computer science that involves the software development process of designing, developing,testing and maintaining software.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
    Software engineering is a discipline that is process-oriented. There is focus on the entire lifecycle of the software from conception, to design, to testing and maintenance of the product. This differs from traditional program which focuses on writing code into a computer. This code is a set of instructions in a particular language which will create an effect or program in the computer.
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase. The Software Development Life Cycle is a structured process used to conceptualize, design and maintain software. It has seven phases:
    1. Planning - This involves sitting down with the client and defining the product. 
    2. Requirement Analysis - Here, the products requirements are carefully listed and analyzed. For example, the product may require user registration, log in and log out page, and a dashboard. All these are discussed with the client and software engineering team in presence.This phase goes hand in hand with the planning phase.
    3. Designing - Once the client's product is defined and planned out, the achitecture of the software is agreed upon in the designing phase. It involves making decisions on the user interface, algorithm, and overall structure. 
    4. Implementation and coding - Lines of code are writtent, using the most appropriate language, to dictate the design agreed upon. 
    5. Testing - This phase involves using the product for the purpose of examining and evaluating its usability. From the feedback, improvements are made on the code.
    6. Deployment - When the product has been refined, it is rolled out to the target market. This step involves the installation, configuration and set up of the product.
    7. Maintenance - Testing and modifying continues even after the product has been rolled out. This may include fixing defects and adding features. 
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
    The Agile and Waterfall models in software development are processes that involve the software development cycle but in different ways.
    The Agile model involves a more flexible approach. For example if the client would like a web application, the process of defining, designing, implementation, testing and deployment and maintenance begins. The product will be released to the client in short intervals, during which the client can ask for changes/improvements. By the time the product is finished, client satisfaction is assured. 
    The Waterfall model involves a more linear and rigid approach. The phases of defining, designing, implementation, testing ad deployment are followed susequently. The client is only involved in the first and last phase. Once one phase is completed and the next phase begins, there is no going back to the previous phase. 
    Hence, the Agile model is more flexible, can take a shorter time, and customer satisfaction is assured (because of involvement) compared to the Waterfall model which is more rigid, takes a longer time, and there is no participation of the client during the process. 
    The Agile model of software development is preferred for long term projects while the Waterfall model is preferred for short term projects.
Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Requirements engineering is the process of gathering information of the product requirements from the stakeholders in order to ensure that the final product meets the needs of the users and the objectives are achieved. The steps of requirement engineering include:
    1. Requirements elicitation and analysis - This is what the stakeholders require from the system. Requirements are sourced from the users, managers, stakeholders or other relevant parties. They are then analyzed to ensure everything is clear and there no ambiguities in the requirements of the project 
    2.Requirements documentation - It involves explaining the requirements in a clear and concise manner so that it is comprehensive to all the stakeholders.
    3.Requirements validation - Here, verification of the documentation is done to ensure the product will meet the user needs. It can be done through prototyping and reviews.
    4.Requirements management - The requirements are managed incase of changes that arise. Procedures are defined on how to go about these changes and events that may affect the requirements.
The requirements engineering process is one of the foundational steps in the software development cycle and therefore important in delivery of successful software projects. Involevement of the stakeholders throughout the process ensures the product meets the user needs.
Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
    Modular design in software architectural design involves the formation of self-containing components of the design that are brought together to make up a system that operates as a whole. For example, Twitter is an example of an apllication that employs the modular design principle whereby content such as Twitter spaces, Communities and the user's tweets are used to create a personalized user experience through the algorithmic recommendation service. 
    Modular design improves maintainability of software system because its design involves smaller units which are easier to manage and maintain. This also makes it easier for improvements and changes to be introduced to the modules without altering the whole system, therefore improving its scalability.
Testing in Software Engineering: 

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
    Unit testing - This is the initial stage of testing that involves testing a module. 
    Integration testing - This is when two or more modules are integrated. There are four ways in which it can be done:
        Big-bang - Here, all modules are required to be complete and then integrated. The integration is then tested as a whole.
        Top-down - testing is done from the high-level modules to the low-level ones
        Bottom-up - testing is done from the low-level modules to the high-level modules
        Hybrid - it involves applying both top-down and bottom up integration. Integration begins from the middle layer, and proceeds up and down simultaneously. 
    System testing - involves testing of the system as a whole to ensure that its requirements have been met.
    Acceptance testing - In this level, the aim is to ensure user needs have been met and the software works well in the user environement. 
    Testing is crucial in the software development because it ensures that in each phase of the design process, feedback is consistenlty been sort, corrections are made and improvements are applied. Through testing, the product is more likely to meet requirements and user needs.  
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Version control systems are a category of software tools that keep track of modifications made to a file and can be accessed by a group of developers. They play a crucial role in software development whereby a group of developers are able to obtain a source code, modify it and the system will keep track of each modification and who made it. This means that developers are able to collaborate on a project throught the version control system.
Examples include: 
    Github - it is a repository to host Git projects. Software teams can collaborate and maintain code history.
    GitLabs -It has a continuous integration capabilities feature that allows for testing and delivering code.
    Beanstalk - It is based on browser and cloud allowing users to code, commit, review and deploy using the browser. It is a great choice for those who choose to work remotely.
    Perforce - Its key feature is the Helixcore which comes with a single platform for seamless team collaboration.
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
A software project manager is oversees the development of the project and ensuring that in all phases of planning, execution and delivery the product is consistent with the user needs.
Some key responsibilities of a software engineer include: 
    Planning the project
    Establishing a team
    Resource and budget management
    Communication
    Documentation and reporting
    Stakeholder management
Some challenges faced include:
    Unexpected changes that alter the budget or expected time of delivery
    Inadequate communication and ollaboration among team members
    Ambiguity in requirement documentations
    Scope creep which occurs when changes made in requirements are not adjusted in the budget or project plan
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Software maintenance is the process by which software is routinely checked, corrected, debugged and improved in order to ensure that the product is still running properly and meets the needs of the user.This usually occurs after the product has been released to the user. 
Types of maintenance activities include:
Corrective maintenance- occurs when bugs and errors are fixed
Preventive maintenance- involves taking precautionary action against problems that may arise in the future
Adaptive maintenance- this is when changes are made in the product as a result of environmental demands such as regulations or upcoming trends.
Perfective maintenance - involves improving the performance and functionality of the software.
Patching - involves corrective measures done often due to pressure from management. 
It is an important step because it ensures that the product continues to meet the users needs.
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Some ethical issues include:
    Addictive design - this occurs when the product is loved and consumed in excess by the users, for example, social media applications.
    Corporate ownership of personal data - this involves the obtaining of personal data from user patterns while interacting with the product. This data is usually shared to other companies with the intention of generating revenue.
    Weak cyber security and personal identifiiable information program - It often occurs when hackers breach the security of the software and are able to alter its structure and possibly access user data.
    Algorithm bias- it often occurs as a result of AI learning from the training it is given, which sometimes is as a result of lack of intentionality of the developer. It ends up developing strong biases towards potential users. 
To avoid challenges, software enginners should:
    familiarize themselves with social and ethical requirements of software developers.
    prioritize data security of its users
    eliminate biases
    ensure transparency and accountability
